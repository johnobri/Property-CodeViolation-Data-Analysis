# Property-CodeViolation-Data-Analysis

This repository is intended to provide access to a Python-based workbook 
for analyzing residential housing data and municipal code violations.
Ultimately, these scripts can be used to help identify the general largest 
property owners as well as the largest problem properties owners in a given 
area.

Assessment roll and code violation data referenced in the script can be
found here: https://data.buffalony.gov/. Modifications to column names used
in establishing subsets may need to be made depending on your data source.
